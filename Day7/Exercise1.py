Assignment 1: Structured CSV & JSON Data Processor

Scenario

An academic registrar stores student course registrations in a CSV file.
You need to read this file, compute overall statistics, and export a summarized JSON report.

Problem Description
Create a function process_student_records(input_csv_path, output_json_path):
Reads an input_csv_path containing columns: student_id, name, course, score.
Uses csv.DictReader inside a context manager to parse all rows.
Computes:
total_students: Total number of students processed.
average_score: Arithmetic mean of all student scores (rounded to 2 decimal places).
top_scorer: The dictionary {"name": <name>, "score": <score>} of the highest scoring student.
course_counts: A dictionary mapping each course name to the count of enrolled students.
Writes the summary dictionary into output_json_path formatted with an indentation of 4 
spaces using json.dump().
Example Walkthrough
# Given input CSV:
# student_id,name,course,score
# 101,Arham,AI,88.5
# 102,Lisa,BDA,94.0
# 103,Vinod,AI,96.5

process_student_records("students.csv", "summary.json")

# Expected summary.json output:
# {
#     "total_students": 3,
#     "average_score": 93.0,
#     "top_scorer": {
#         "name": "Vinod",
#         "score": 96.5
#     },
#     "course_counts": {
#         "AI": 2,
#         "BDA": 1
#     }
# }
